# Mark Time
Final Project at Andela Bootcamp

Mark Time was created to provide a secure way for organisations to log the attendance of their employees and guests.


Users can sign in with secure login details, sign out and view the attendance register for the day.

Features for administrators including adding new employees, removing employees and clearing the register for the day.


#How To Use
Sign in with a company email address and password.

If you don't have one, you can sign in as a guest or with admin priviledges, add a new employee.


#Guest Sign In
Guests will be given a code on sign in which they must use to sign out. This ensures that each guest is unique and avoids false sign outs.
